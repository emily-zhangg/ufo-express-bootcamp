{"sightings":[{"text":"Glowing lights in formation  just south of San Quentin I witnessed 10 or 11 spherical glowing objects in formation swarming and hovering near the top of Ring Mtn. -Corte Madera.  I very quickly ran up to 2 firemen emergency responders to ask them to quote \"take a quick glance at what is going on over here\".  They flat out refused to take 5 steps over to the side to look at what I was trying to show them.  They were handling some kind of a medical emergency, but it would have been really nice to have them witness this because this was highlight of the whole night.","date_time":"10/2/19 22:00","city":"Marin County","state":"CA","shape":"Sphere","duration":"3 minutes","summary":"Glowing lights in formation  just south of San Quentin","dateCreated":"2021-05-12"},{"description":"","date_time":"","city":"","state":"","shape":"","duration":"","summary":"","dateCreated":"2021-05-12"}]}
